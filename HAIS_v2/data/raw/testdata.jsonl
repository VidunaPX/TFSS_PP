This creates two right triangles: \\( \\triangle ACD \\) and \\( \\triangle BCD \\).\n\n2. **Use Right Triangle Trigonometry:**\n   - In \\( \\triangle ACD \\), \\( \\sin A = \\frac{h}{b} \\), where \\( h \\) is the length of the perpendicular (altitude) and \\( b \\) is the length of side AC. Rearranging gives \\( h = b \\sin A \\).\n   - In \\( \\triangle BCD \\), \\( \\sin B = \\frac{h}{a} \\), where \\( a \\) is the length of side BC. Rearranging gives \\( h = a \\sin B \\).\n\n3. **Equate Expressions for \\( h \\):** Since \\( h \\) is the same in both triangles, set the equations equal: \\( b \\sin A = a \\sin B \\). Rearranging gives \\( \\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} \\).\n\n4. **Repeat for the Third Side:** Drop a perpendicular from another vertex (e.g., A to side BC) and follow similar steps. This shows that \\( \\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} \\).\n\n5. **Combine Results:** From the two proofs above, \\( \\frac{a}{\\sin A} = \\frac{b}{\\sin B} = \\frac{c}{\\sin C} \\), completing the proof.\n\nThis law is useful for solving triangles when given two angles and a side (AAS or ASA) or two sides and a non-included angle (SSA).
